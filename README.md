For Buzz and Fizz we used images of Buzz Lightyear from "Toy Story" and Fizz from "League of Legends".

Buzz Lightyear is a fictional space ranger character from the "Toy Story" franchise created by Pixar and Disney. He is known for his catchphrase, "To infinity and beyond!" and serves as one of the main characters, embodying bravery and heroism.

Fizz is a champion in the game "League of Legends" by Riot Games. He is a mischievous and agile amphibious character, known as the Tidal Trickster, who uses his trident and water-based abilities to outmaneuver and defeat his opponents.
